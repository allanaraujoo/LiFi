##  Project work by Premangshu Chanda, Shubham Chatterjee, Asoke Nath

The aim of the project is to be able to transfer data using LEDs. The technique is called Li-Fi technology.

Version 1
	-> Audio Transmission using Li-Fi
	-> Circuits: Phone Circuit as Transmitter, Speaker circuit as Receiver
	-> Components: 3.5 mm audio jack, Breadboard, Wires, Cables:  Male to Male and Male to female, 100 ohm and 1Kohm resistors, Alligator clips, 9V battery
	-> 6V solar cell, Speaker with 3.5 mm audio In, 2 way 3.5 mm  jack
	-> Setup as in the circuits 
	-> Audio transmitted successfully
	
	Version 1 released!!
	
Version 2
	-> Including Arduino UNO ATMEGA32 in the project
	
	-> Completed Connection of Arduino with LEDs
	-> Completed Connection of Arduino with LDR
	-> Successfully blinked LEDs
	-> Successfully transmitted a single data
	-> Some errors in code --- NEED TO FIX THAT!!!
	-> SOME errors in connection for Li-Fi transmission ---- NEED TO FIX THAT!!
	-> Added lifi.txt -- This program has run successfully with sending an integer value and receiving another integer value
	-> Added Data Transmitter code. Compiled fine. No output from Arduino.
	---- Modification needed for code.
